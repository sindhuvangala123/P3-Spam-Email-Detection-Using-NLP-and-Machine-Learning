<h1>Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning</h1>
<p>This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The following steps were taken to develop the spam email classification model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: A dataset of labeled emails (spam or ham) was collected.</li>
<li>Data Preprocessing: The email text data was preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.</li>
<li>Feature Extraction: Features were extracted from the preprocessed data using techniques such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF.</li>
<li>Model Training: A machine learning model was trained using the extracted features and labeled data.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code Explanation</h2>
<p>The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>NLTK: For NLP tasks such as tokenization and stemming.</li>
<li>Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as feature extraction and model training.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code consists of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data loading and preprocessing</li>
<li>Feature extraction</li>
<li>Model training and evaluation</li>
<li>Prediction and classification</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The trained model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy] on the test dataset.</p>
<p>The precision and recall values were [insert precision and recall].</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates the use of NLP and machine learning techniques for spam email classification.</p>
<p>The results show that the trained model can accurately classify emails as spam or ham.</p>
